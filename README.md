# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I sought to create a webpage to help keep track of class work. 
- I built this project because it reinforces many of the skills that will be later used during bootcamp. It holds a dual puprose in being a tool for note taking as well as a tool for learning hands on code.
- The webpage will allow me to better keep track of progress in class of notes as well as important reminders.
- This project gave me the foundations of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the use of Git, as well as creating a README.
